## 80k Twins – Custom Link Hub

This is a standalone, static homepage for the **80k Twins** – designed to be your very cool, all-in-one link hub.

### Files

- **index.html**: Main page markup.
- **styles.css**: All layout, colors, and animation styles.
- **script.js**: Scroll reveal + subtle background parallax.

### How to open

- On macOS, double–click `index.html` (or right–click → Open With → your browser).
- Or drag–drop `index.html` into Chrome, Safari, or any modern browser.

### Customize it

- **Update text**: Edit section copy directly in `index.html` (hero, about, collab, etc.).
- **Swap links**: Search in `index.html` for `tiktok.com`, `instagram.com`, `youtube.com`, `stake.us`, and the `mailto:` address and replace them with your real URLs and email.
- **Add a photo**:
  - Drop an image into the project (for example `assets/80ktwins-hero.jpg`).
  - In `styles.css`, find the `.hero-avatar` block and change the `background` to use your image instead of the gradient.

This site is 100% static – you can upload it to any host (Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, etc.) or keep it as a simple link-in-bio landing page.
